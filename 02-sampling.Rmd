# Sampling
As we described in the Cycle of Research, **statistical inference** is the process of drawing conclusions about a population on the basis of observations from a sample. Put another way, statistical inference is the process of generalizing study results from the study sample to the population of interest. Drawing correct inferences about the population depends on knowing how representative the sample is of that population. A sample is representative of the population if every person or unit in the population of interest has the same chance of being included in the sample. If the chance of being included in the sample differs from person to person, then we are vulnerable to selection bias, which will affect our ability to make accurate inferences about the population.
