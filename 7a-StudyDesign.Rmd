The design of a study is an extremely important part of doing research. The study design is essentially a blueprint for the collection, measurement, and analysis of the data. It is often argued that the design of a study is more important than the analysis of the results, because if the study design is poor, then the study may not be able to achieve its objective at all, whereas if the study is poorly analyzed, the data can be reanalyzed to reach meaningful conclusions. Different study designs are needed to answer different research questions. The purpose of this lecture is to describe several common types of study designs. We have adapted a taxonomy developed by Grimes and Shultz1 to illustrate a few common study designs used in medical and public health research. Research designs can be divided into two broad categories: observational studies and experimental studies. 

In an observational study, the researcher does not assign exposures to participants. The exposure is the agent under investigation that is thought to be related to the outcome being measured. For example, we may be interested in exposure to heavy metals and its relationship with sinus cancer. Or we may be interested in exposure to repeated cell phone use and its relationship with brain tumors. In all these examples, the exposure is not, or cannot be, assigned by the researcher, for practical or ethical reasons. Examples of observational studies include case series studies, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, and longitudinal or cohort studies. 
 
In an experimental study, the researcher assigns exposures, often called treatments in this setting, to participants. For example, we may be interested in the relationship of Laetrile treatment and human cancer. Or we may be interested in the relationship between regular aspirin use and heart attack or death. In these examples, the researcher can decide which participants will receive which treatments. Several subtypes of experimental studies can be defined by whether they include a comparison group or not, or whether they randomly assign the participants to the exposure or not. 

We will discuss observational studies first.

The lancet, 359(9300), 57-61.A case series study is an observational study in which a series of participants are observed and the course of their disease or other participant characteristics and outcomes are described. It is similar to a report on a single case (i.e. a case study), but it describes more than one related case. Case series studies typically involve a small number of participants. There is no comparison group. There is no sampling. Case series studies are purely descriptive – no information about the association between the exposure and the outcome can be obtained, and no inference can be made to a larger population. 

Case series studies are typically not planned in advance, but arise due to a researcher or doctor noticing something unusual or unexpected. Publication of observations from a case series may lead to research questions for more rigorously designed studies.Here is an example of a case series study. 

In 1981, Michael Gottlieb and his colleagues at the UCLA School of Medicine reported a rare form of pneumonia and unusual multiple viral infections in four previously healthy young men1. Part of the abstract for this landmark paper is shown here. 

Other similar case series studies followed, and by 1982 the condition was named Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, now commonly known as AIDS.

Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and mucosal candidiasis in previously healthy homosexual men: evidence of a new acquired cellular immunodeficiency. New England Journal of Medicine, 305(24), 1425-1431.The main advantage of case series studies is that they can be comparatively easy and inexpensive. They are useful as a descriptive tool, and can also be useful in designing further studies to provide a better quality of evidence. 

The disadvantages to case series studies include no comparison group. The sample consists of either only exposed participants with the outcome or all persons with the outcome. As a result, it is not possible to determine whether there is an association between exposure and outcome; nor to assess whether there might be a cause-and-effect relationship between exposure and outcome. Another disadvantage is that this type of design is usually retrospective, due to the typical unplanned nature of the study. This can result in problems due to use of historical data.A cross-sectional study is an observational study in which data are collected from participants at a single point in time. This provides a “snapshot” in time of the characteristics of interest. Data for cross-sectional studies are often collected using surveys or polls and can involve a large number of participants. The participants may or may not be randomly selected from the population of interest.

The collected data could include outcome variables of interest, such as disease status, diagnostic test results, or biomarker levels. The data could also include possible explanatory variables, such as exposures to suspected risk factors. Finally the data could include demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, or ethnicity. All of these variables are collected at the same time. The collected data can be used to explore relationships between variables at a single point in time. Cross-sectional study designs are used in prevalence studies to evaluate the prevalence of risk factors, or the prevalence of a disease or condition, in a given population at a certain time. For example, researchers used a cross-sectional study to measure the prevalence of serious eye disease in a north London elderly population in 19981. They can also be used repeatedly to monitor changes in the prevalence of a condition over time. An example of this was a prevalence study of skull fractures in children admitted to a hospital in Edinburgh from 1983 to 19892. Although the study period was seven years, the information about each subject was recorded at a single point in time, which makes it a cross-sectional study. 

Cross-sectional studies are also used to identify associations between a condition and potential risk factors. These associations can be further explored in future, more rigorous, studies. An example of this type of use of a cross-sectional design is a study that administered a questionnaire to elderly people to explore the relationship between alcohol consumption and emergency room visits3.

Cross-sectional studies are also used to establish norms for diagnostic or screening tests, to compare the agreement between a new test and an established test, or to compare the sensitivity and specificity of a test to the known “gold-standard” diagnosis. An example of this was a study that compared the accuracy of detecting gonorrhea in women between self-taken swab and clinician-taken swab cultures4.

There is no follow-up of participants, so fewer resources are required to carry out the study. Another advantage is that they are useful for identifying potential relationships that can then be studied more rigorously using a cohort or experimental study design.

There are three main disadvantages to cross-sectional studies. The first is that cross-sectional studies do not provide any support for cause-and-effect relationships between variables. Since the data are collected at a single point in time, it is not possible to determine whether exposure to a risk factor preceded the outcome of interest. Cross-sectional data give no information about the disease process or natural history.

The second disadvantage is that rare diseases or conditions can’t efficiently be studied because there may be no one with the condition even in large samples. 

The last disadvantage is the potential for bias in survey data. There may be volunteer bias. In a study where the participants are selected by volunteering (as in a radio call-in show, for example), those who volunteer may be different in some ways from those who did not volunteer. The volunteers are a self-selected non-random sample which may not be representative of the population of interest. There may also be non-response bias. In a survey that uses random sampling, some of the randomly chosen subjects may refuse to participate in the study. The non-responders may differ from the responders in some way, resulting in a sample which is not representative of the population of interest. Non-response bias is considered a particular problem if a large percentage of those contacted refuse to participate.
A case-control study is an observational study in which participants are selected based on their disease status. “Cases” are people who already have the disease or condition of interest. “Controls” are individuals from a similar population who do not have the disease or condition. The cases and controls may or may not be randomly selected. Researchers then look backward in time for past exposures to suspected risk factors that might have resulted in the condition. Past exposure may be ascertained from interviews with the participants themselves, from interviews with family members (particularly if the participant is deceased), or from medical records.

Case-control studies are often called “retrospective studies” because the outcome already occurred before the participant was included in the study.

Case-control studies are useful for exploring the relationship between a disease (or some other outcome) and possible risk factors, especially if the disease is rare.An example of a case-control study is an investigation into the potential association between cell phone use and brain tumors, published in 2001 in the New England Journal of Medicine1. The researchers identified 782 people with various types of brain tumors (the “cases”), and 799 people with various non-malignant conditions (the “controls”). They assessed exposure to cell phone use by interviewing the participants. They did not find any evidence for an association between cell phone use and brain tumors.

Cellular-telephone use and brain tumors. New England Journal of Medicine, 344(2), 79-86.Case-control studies are invaluable for studying rare diseases, because you can obtain an adequate number of cases for the study and not have to wait for the condition or disease to occur as you would in prospective studies. They are also relatively quick and inexpensive in comparison to prospective studies.

However, case-control studies have a number of disadvantages. The first is that case-control studies do not provide any evidence for cause-and-effect relationships between variables. In many cases it is not possible to determine whether exposure to a risk factor preceded the outcome of interest. Case-control data also give no information about the disease process or natural history.

Another disadvantage is the potential for bias. One potential source of bias is misclassification bias, which occurs when a case is misclassified as a control, or vice versa. It isn’t always easy to determine disease status. Misclassifying a case or a control may result in a biased (inaccurate) measure of association. Another potential source of bias is recall bias. People do not always accurately remember their exposure history, and cases may be more likely than controls to remember exposure to something they believe may have caused their disease. This also may result in a biased measure of association.

Another disadvantage is that case-control studies cannot be used to estimate the prevalence of a disease or condition in the population. The ratio of cases to controls is chosen in advance by the researcher: common ratios are 1 control for every 1 case, or 2 controls for every 1 case. If a ratio of 1:1 is used, then half of the study sample will be cases and half will be controls. This does not mean that the prevalence of the disease in that population is 50%. The proportion of cases in the study sample is not a measure of the prevalence of the disease in that population.

A final disadvantage is that selection of appropriate controls can be difficult. The ideal control subject is a person who is identical in every possible way to the case subject except that they do not have the disease of interest. This situation cannot be perfectly attained in real life.A cohort study is an observational study in which a group of participants (a cohort) is followed over time to determine how many develop the disease or condition of interest. For this reason, cohort studies are sometimes called follow-up studies or longitudinal studies. The study participants may or may not be randomly selected. All participants in a cohort study are initially “healthy” in the sense that they have not yet had the outcome of interest (for example, a primary heart attack). 

Members of the cohort may be classified as “exposed” or “unexposed” to one or more risk factors at the beginning of the study. For example, study participants could be identified as smokers and non-smokers, or as overweight and normal weight.

Both the “exposed” and the “unexposed” participants in the cohort are followed over time, and the incidence of the disease or condition of interest in each group is determined.

Cohort studies are useful for exploring the relationship between risk factors and disease.Most cohort studies are prospective or forward-looking. In a prospective cohort study, the exposure has already occurred but the outcome has not yet happened. The risk factor exposure is determined in the present, when the participants are enrolled in the study, and information about the outcome is collected at a future time, after the specified length of follow-up.

Cohort studies can also be retrospective or backward-looking. In a retrospective cohort study, both the exposure and the outcome have already occurred. Historical records (such as medical records) are used to assess the risk factor exposure at some point in the past (say, for example, in 1950). The historical records are then used to follow the participants forward over time and collect information about the outcome after the specified length of follow-up time (say, for example, in 1970 after 20 years of follow-up). Retrospective studies are also called “historical cohort studies”. They require complete and accurate historical medical records. 

In both prospective and retrospective cohort studies, though, the participants are initially “healthy” – they do not yet have the disease or condition of interest.An example of a prospective cohort study is the Nurses’ Health Study1. It was started in 1976 and is now in the third generation of the study with over 275,000 participants. The participants fill out a questionnaire once every two years. The original goal of the study was to investigate the risk factors for major chronic diseases in women. The most current study includes both men and women from a variety of health-related fields and examines how dietary patterns, lifestyle, environment, and nursing occupational exposures impact their health. 

Reference:
1https://www.nurseshealthstudy.orgA major advantage of cohort studies, compared to other observational studies, is that they can provide evidence for possible cause-and-effect relationships between exposures and outcomes. This is because in a cohort study, exposure to the risk factors always precedes the outcome of interest, thereby avoiding the debate about which is “cause” and which is “effect”. Cohort studies can also provide information about the disease process or natural history.

Cohort studies have a number of disadvantages, however. The major disadvantage is that they tend to involve large numbers of participants over multiple sites, and may involve follow-up times of years or decades, and can therefore be time-consuming and expensive. Another major disadvantage is that the long follow-up times can result in large numbers of participants dropping out or being lost to follow-up, which can introduce bias.

Another disadvantage is that cohort designs are not suitable for very rare outcomes. If the outcome is extremely rare, then an extremely large cohort will need to be followed in order to obtain enough outcome events. This is prohibitively expensive.

Retrospective cohort studies, as mentioned previously, cannot be conducted at all unless complete and accurate medical records covering the full time-period of interest are available.

A last disadvantage is the potential for selection bias, that is, obtaining a sample that is not representative of the population of interest. For example, the researchers from the original Nurses’ Health Study wanted to make inferences about women, in general. However, their sample only contained women who were nurses, and we should not presume that women nurses are representative of all women. In contrast to observational studies, experimental studies involve the investigator controlling some intervention, such as a treatment, for the study participants. Examples of interventions of interest in medical or public health research include a new drug, a new surgical procedure, an education or counseling program, or an exercise program. The study participants are followed over time in order to determine the effect of the treatment on the disease or condition of interest. Experimental studies can involve one or more comparison (or “control”) groups or no control groups (which would be called an “uncontrolled” study). They also may involve random assignment (known as randomization) of participants to treatments. 

Experimental studies include laboratory studies, pre-clinical or animal studies, and clinical trials. We will focus here on clinical trials.

Grimes, D. A., & Schulz, K. F. (2002). An overview of clinical research: the lay of the land. The lancet, 359(9300), 57-61.As previously mentioned, experimental studies can be designed with or without a comparison group. 

A controlled trial involves an internal comparison or “control” group. The control group consists of participants who do not receive the intervention or treatment of interest. Instead, they may receive no treatment at all, a placebo, the current standard-of-care treatment (if there is one), or even the same treatment but delayed until a later time. The presence of a control group that is similar in every other way to the treatment group, except that it did not receive the treatment, allows the investigators to attribute any group differences in outcomes or responses to the treatment itself.

An uncontrolled trial does not involve an internal comparison group. It is still considered an experimental study, though, because the investigator directly administers some intervention or treatment to the study participants. This method of investigation has some similarities with both case-control and cohort studies. However, unlike in case-control studies, there is follow-up of participants over a period of time until the outcome is observed or the study ends. And unlike in a cohort study, the intervention is planned and administered to participants, rather than just observed. Sometimes, in the early stages of understanding a new intervention, an uncontrolled design may be used. The gold standard for medical and public health research is the randomized controlled clinical trial (RCCT or RCT). For the purposes of this class, we define an RCT as a prospective study where assignment of participants to an intervention group or a control group is random. Other study designs lack either randomization or a comparison group or both. An RCT need not have a placebo group. Frequently, an RCT compares two or more active treatment groups. In some cases, the control group is the current standard-of-care, which is then compared to one or more “experimental” treatments.  Many people use the term clinical trial loosely when referencing a non-randomized study design; thus you cannot assume that a reference to a “clinical trial” is to a randomized controlled clinical trial. The distinctions between random sampling and random assignment can sometimes be difficult to grasp. 

Random sampling is the process of selecting study participants randomly from the population of interest. (To give a very old-fashioned example, random sampling could be done by drawing names out of a hat). Each person has the same chance of being selected for the study. This ensures that the study sample is representative of the population of interest. In randomized controlled clinical trials, however, random sampling is seldom used and convenience sampling is much more common. Participants are typically selected based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria and this selection process does not necessarily involve random sampling. 

Random assignment (also called ‘randomization’) is the process of assigning study participants randomly to treatment or control groups. (To give another very old-fashioned example, random assignment could be done by tossing a coin for each participant and assigning ‘heads’ to ‘treatment’ and ‘tails’ to ‘control’). This ensures that the treatment and control groups are balanced and comparable in all characteristics (both known and unknown), so that any differences observed can be correctly attributed to the treatment.
Controlled trials are often conducted using some degree of blinding. Blinding is the act of keeping study personnel (participants, investigators, or assessors) unaware of the assigned treatment to promote objective assessment of outcomes and therefore reduce bias. In a placebo-controlled trial with blinding, the control participants receive a placebo that is designed to be indistinguishable from the active treatment.

Here are the typical categories of blinding:

In a single-blind study, the study participants do not know whether they are in the treatment or the control group.

In a double-blind study, both the study participants and the physicians/investigators are unaware of the treatment assignments. 

In a triple-blind study, the study participants, the investigators, and the data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) are all unaware of the treatment assignments. (Note that this study design usually involves having at least two statisticians: a DSMB statistician who is blinded and who assists the DSMB in making decisions about continuing the study, and a study statistician who created the randomization plan for the study and thus is not blinded.)An example of a randomized controlled clinical trial is the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, often abbreviated MRFIT and pronounced “Mister Fit”. In this trial, which began in 1971, 12,866 men with three specific risk factors for coronary heart disease (high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking) were randomly assigned to two groups. The “special intervention” group received special interventions intended to reduce the levels of the risk factors (for example, smoking cessation counseling) in addition to usual physician care, while the control or “usual care” group received usual physician care alone. Both groups were followed for six to eight years. The outcome or endpoint of interest was death from coronary heart disease.

The trial results appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 19821. The investigators found that the risk factor levels declined in both groups, but they declined slightly more in the special intervention group. However, mortality due to coronary heart disease, as well as all-cause mortality, did not differ significantly between the two groups.

The RCT design minimizes confounding from both known and measured factors and from unknown factors, since the random assignment ensures that the treatment groups are comparable: any potential confounding variables, whether measured in the study or not, will be evenly distributed between the groups. It is extremely difficult or impossible to completely control for confounding in an observational study.

What is confounding, you say? Confounding is when the relationship between the treatment (or exposure) and the outcome is interfered with (or ‘confounded by’) a third variable. An example would be a (fictional) study of the relationship between coffee drinking and cancer. The study might observe that coffee drinkers are at higher risk of cancer, but this apparent relationship might really be due to smoking. If coffee drinkers are more likely to smoke, then the smoking could be responsible for the increased cancer risk, not the coffee. Smoking in this example would be a confounding factor.

The primary disadvantage of randomized controlled clinical trials is that they are time-consuming and expensive. There is still some potential for bias in a randomized trial, although the randomization itself removes many potential sources of bias. Procedure bias may occur when the treatment group receives more attention than the control group. Recall bias may occur when subjects in one group are more likely to remember events than subjects in another group. This would only cause bias if the outcome were self-reported. Compliance bias may occur when patients comply with one treatment more than another. When reading the medical or public health literature, pay careful attention to the description of the study design. It should provide enough information to enable the reader to answer these key questions of interest from a statistical perspective: 

Was the study observational or experimental? How were the data collected? 

For an observational study: What study design was used? Was random sampling used? If so, how was it implemented? What are some potential sources of bias?

For an experimental study: What study design was used? Was the study controlled? Was it blinded? What are the characteristics of the study sample? Was random assignment used? If so, how was it implemented? What are some potential sources of bias?
