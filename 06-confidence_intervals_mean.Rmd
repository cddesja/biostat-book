This lecture will continue exploring the concept of confidence intervals and will focus on confidence intervals for a mean.
Every winter, warnings are issued about the increased risk of cardiac events while shoveling snow. Examples include a Popular Science article titled ?Don?t let snow shoveling give you a heart attack? (from Jan. 4, 2018) or a Weather Network article titled ?Winter safety: How shoveling snow can lead to a heart attack? (from Dec. 28, 2017). 

A study was designed to compare cardiac demands among people who shoveled snow manually compared to those who used a electric snow blower1. Ten apparently healthy untrained men cleared tracks of snow using both methods and their maximum heart rates (in beats per minute, or BPM) were recorded during both activities. Let?s just focus on the situation when the men shoveled snow manually. 

For this study of 10 men, the mean maximum heart rate when they shoveled the snow manually was 175 beats per minute (BPM), with a standard deviation of 15 BPM. 

We know that this sample mean value of 175 BPM is an estimate of the population mean. More specifically, the sample mean maximum heart rate value, x-bar, is a point estimate of the population mean maximum heart rate, ? (mu). It is our single best guess of what the true unknown population value may be, based on the data we have. But we know that sample mean values vary from one sample to another, due to sampling variability. How confident are we that we have indeed estimated accurately the heart rates for healthy men when they are dealing with snow?

JAMA, 273(11).As we did in a previous lecture, we can use our sample data to calculate a confidence interval for the true population mean. This confidence interval is an interval estimate of the true mean because it consists of a range or interval of values instead of a single number. The center of the interval marks the point estimate and the width of the interval reflects the precision (or ?exactness?) of our estimate. 

For our example, the sample mean is 175 BPM, and a 95% confidence interval for the true population mean is 164.3 to 185.7 BPM. 

A confidence interval for a mean is an estimate of the population mean, ? (mu), which reflects the precision of the estimate. We can also say that a confidence interval for a mean is an interval around the sample mean, x-bar, which will include the true population mean a specified percent of time.

So how do we calculate this confidence interval from the data?
The general formula for a confidence interval is the point estimate plus or minus the margin of error, where the point estimate is the sample statistic and the margin of error is a value for degree of confidence times the standard error of the sample statistic. 

Using what we know about sampling distributions of means and the general formula for confidence intervals, we can construct the confidence interval for a mean. 

Recall that if the sample size, n, is large enough, then the Central Limit Theorem applies. This means that the sampling distribution of sample means will be approximately Normal with a mean equal to the true population mean and a standard error (SE) equal to the population standard deviation (sigma) divided by the square root of n. This tells us that for 95% of the sample means (the ones in the middle of the sampling distribution) the true population mean is going to be within ~1.96 standard errors of that sample mean, and for the other 5% of the sample means (the ones in the tails), the true population mean is going to be further than ~1.96 standard errors from that sample mean. (This is another example of the ?flip? in thinking we first discussed in a previous lecture.) So if we put an interval of +/- ~1.96 standard errors around?any?observed sample mean, then 95% of the time, this interval will contain the true population mean.

The equation for a 95% confidence interval for a population mean is thus the sample mean plus or minus 1.96 standard errors. 

We can construct a confidence interval for a mean for any arbitrary confidence level, y%, (such as 90%, or 99%), just as we did for proportions, using the appropriate z-value. The appropriate z-value to use is the value on the Standard Normal curve such that the area of 1-(alpha/2) lies below that value. For 95% confidence, alpha would be 0.05, and we would look for z-value such that 0.975 of the total area (which is 1 minus 0.05 divided by 2) lies below that value. 

Putting it all together, we end up with a confidence interval for a population mean, mu, equal to the sample mean, x-bar, plus or minus the margin of error, where the margin of error equals the z-value times the standard error of the mean. The standard error of the mean equals the population standard deviation, sigma, divided by the square root of the sample size, n. Let?s use the confidence interval equation to calculate an interval estimate for our Heart Rate and Snow Shoveling example. 

A 95% confidence interval for the population mean maximum heart rate for men who shovel snow is 175 plus or minus 1.96 times the population standard deviation, sigma (?), divided by the square root of our sample size, which was n=10. 

Do you see an issue with this calculation? What value is unknown to us? If you said the population standard deviation, sigma, you would be correct. The Central Limit Theorem only applies exactly if we know the standard deviation of the population. In real life, we almost never do. 

But we can estimate the value of the population standard deviation using our data. What value from our data would be our ?best guess? of what the population standard deviation would be? Answer: The sample standard deviation, s, is our ?best guess? or estimate of the population standard deviation, sigma (?). So we can replace the population standard deviation, sigma, in our equation above with the sample standard deviation, s. 

However, this estimation of the standard deviation introduces a bit more uncertainty in our confidence interval estimate, and the uncertainty will be higher when the sample size is smaller.  We need to account for this extra uncertainty when creating our confidence interval. We account for this extra uncertainty in using s, the sample standard deviation, instead of sigma, the population standard deviation, by using a distribution that has extra area in its tails: the t-distribution, instead of the Standard Normal or z-distribution. 

When we have s instead of sigma, the standardized sampling distribution of sample means is no longer a Standard Normal distribution. When we use s, an estimate of sigma, the standardized sampling distribution of sample means now has a t-distribution. Every theoretical distribution is completely defined by an equation with particular characteristics or ?parameters?. For example, the Binomial distribution is characterized by a sample size, n, and a proportion, p; a Normal distribution is characterized by a mean, ?, and a standard deviation, ?). The t-distribution is no different. The t-distribution is characterized by the size of the sample, which is reflected in a parameter called the degrees of freedom (df). When we are making inferences for a single mean, the t-distribution has n-1 degrees of freedom. In the Heart Rate and Snow Shoveling example, the degrees of freedom for the t-distribution is 10 ? 1, which equals 9.

The shape of the t-distribution is similar to that of the Standard Normal or z-distribution (symmetric, unimodal, centered at zero), but when the sample size is small, the t-distribution has more variability (thicker tails). As the sample size increases, the t-distribution narrows and approaches the Standard Normal distribution. This can be seen in the plot above. As the degrees of freedom increase from 3 to 15, we see that the t-distribution curve gets closer and closer to the Standard Normal distribution. This makes sense because we expect a larger sample to tend to give a better estimate of the population standard deviation, sigma, so our extra uncertainty by using s becomes less. Putting it all together, we end up with a confidence interval for a population mean, mu, equal to the sample mean, x-bar, plus or minus the margin of error, where the margin of error equals a constant value from the t-distribution (called a t-value) times the estimated standard error of the mean. The estimated standard error of the mean equals the sample standard deviation, s, divided by the square root of the sample size, n. 

Recall that the margin of error reflects the precision of our estimate of the population mean. Note that we are assuming that our sample is a random sample from the population, so that it is representative of the population and gives us an unbiased estimate of both the standard deviation and the mean. An accurate estimate is one that is both precise and unbiased. 

What factors affect the precision of our estimate? Looking at the equation, we can see that the margin of error will be wider, less precise, if the variability in the population (estimated by the sample standard deviation, s) is higher. The margin of error will be smaller, more precise, as the sample size, n, increases, both because the standard error (SE) decreases and because the t-value decreases. And the margin of error will be wider if a higher degree of confidence (such as 99% confidence vs. 95% confidence) is desired, since the t-values increase with increasing confidence level. (If you want to be more sure of ?catching? the true mean, you must use a wider ?net?.) 
Now let?s finish creating a confidence interval for our Heart Rate and Snow Shoveling example. 

The sample mean maximum heart rate of men who shovel snow is 175 BPM and the sample standard deviation is 15 BPM, so an estimate for the SE of x-bar equals 15/sqrt(10) = 4.743. If we want to be 95% confident, then y = 95 and alpha = 0.05. The t-value is the value in the t-distribution with n-1 = 9 degrees of freedom which gives 0.975 area lying below that value, so the t-value is 2.262. This gives a margin of error of 2.262*4.743 = 10.730. Our 95% confidence interval for the true population mean maximum heart rate for men who shovel snow is 175 plus or minus 10.730, which gives 164.3 to 185.7.

We interpret our confidence interval by saying ?I am y% confident that this interval contains the true population mean.? 

In our example, we could say: 
?I am 95% confident that the interval from 164.3 to 185.7 BPM contains the true mean maximum heart rate for men who shovel snow.?
Or, we could say:
?A plausible range of values for the true mean maximum heart rate for men who shovel snow is from 164.3 to 185.7 BPM.?
Recall that the t-value in the confidence interval equation is determined by the confidence level and the sample size in the study.  So unlike with the z-values presented in a previous lecture, there isn?t one set t-value for a particular confidence level. The table above provides the t-values for the corresponding confidence levels and degrees of freedom. As already mentioned, t-values are larger for larger confidence levels and smaller for smaller confidence levels. As a result, larger confidence levels produce confidence intervals that are wider. You will also notice that as the degrees of freedom increase, the t-values start to approach the z-values presented in a previous lecture (z = 1.645, 1.96, and 2.575 for 90, 95 and 99% confidence levels, respectively). This is also expected since the t-distribution approaches the Standard Normal distribution as the sample size increases.

To find the t-value, use software or a table that displays values of the t-distribution. If using a table and the table does not include the exact number of degrees of freedom for your situation, use the closest value, or, if you want to be more conservative, use the next lower number of degrees of freedom found in the table.

It is important to realize that when one single study is carried out, the confidence interval calculated may miss the true value. This will only happen in roughly 5% of the studies (for a 95% confidence level), but this study might be one of those studies. There is no way of knowing, since we don?t know what the true population mean is. (If we did know it, we wouldn?t need to do the study!)Statistical inference for a mean relies on several assumptions. 

We assume that the sample is a random (or representative) sample from the population of interest. In this way, we are able to generalize the results from this study to the larger population of interest. This assumption could be violated, for example, if we wanted to generalize the maximum heart rates to the population of all adults, both men and women, since our example study only investigated men. The average heart rate for women is higher than for men, so the results from our non-representative (all male) sample would be biased low and would not be generalizable to the population of interest.

We assume that the observations are independent of each other. Selecting one member of the population should not change the chance of selecting any other member. This assumption would be violated, for example, if siblings were included in the sample. Siblings may share genetic factors that affect heart rate and so might be more similar to each other than two people chosen at random would be. This assumption would also be violated if some men?s heart rates were measured twice and both values were included in the data. 

The sampling distribution of sample means should be approximately Normal. How can we check this assumption? We can check to see if the conditions for the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) hold. Recall that if the underlying population distribution is approximately Normal (which we can check to some extent by plotting the sample distribution), then the sampling distribution of sample means is approximately Normal. OR, even if the underlying population distribution is not Normal, if the sample size is ?large enough? (and what is ?large enough? depends on how heavily skewed the population distribution is), then the sampling distribution will still be approximately Normal. If this assumption is not met, use other methods for computing a confidence interval for a mean (such as bootstrapping).

If these assumptions are not met, then the calculated confidence interval cannot be used as an estimate of the population value, because the calculated confidence interval may be too narrow, suggesting a more precise estimate than we actually have, or it might be centered at the wrong place (biased), and hence more likely to ?miss? the true population mean.
